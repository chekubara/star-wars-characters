# Star Wars Characters Example Project

This project is a Star Wars Characters example built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The application fetches data from the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/) REST API.

The state management is handled by [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), which helps maintain and preserve users' favorite characters between page reloads.

Animations in the project are implemented using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
